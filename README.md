## General Information

Because of the current demand for instant coffee or tea, the programmers decided to develop a shopping business system that is related to the shop's day-to-day operations. The Python programming language and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts were used to create this system. In software, encapsulation and inheritance are used specifically. Furthermore, the programmers used JSON to store employee data, which is retrieved upon logging in, and file handling to keep track of each shop order.

## Admin Interface

An employee must input the admin password to gain access to the admin interface. After verification, each staff (Manager, Barista, Service crew, and Cashier) should log in to open the store system for client interaction.

## Customer Interface

This interface includes the ordering system and the billing system. Customers can add orders and pay the bill associated with their orders. And a reciept will be generated right after a successful transaction.
