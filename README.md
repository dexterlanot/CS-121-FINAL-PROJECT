## General Information

Because of the current need for instant coffee or tea, the programmers chose to create a shopping business system that relates to the shop's day-to-day operations. This system was created with the Python programming language and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Encapsulation and inheritance are specifically employed in the software. In addition, the programmers employed JSON to store employee data, which are retrieved upon logging in, and file handling to keep each shop order information.

## Admin Interface

An employee must input the admin password to gain access to the admin interface. After verification, each staff (Manager, Barista, Service crew, and Cashier) should log in to open the store system for client interaction.

## Customer Interface

This interface includes the ordering system and the billing system. Customers can add orders and pay the bill associated with their orders. And a reciept will be generated right after a successful transaction.
